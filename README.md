# unzip
Script to Unzip All Files in a Directory and Remove the Original Zip File to Save Disk Space.
First it lists all the zip files in a directory to a files.txt file, then it unzips each one and removes the original

Usage is

1. Place script in directory with zip files
2. chmod 755 the script to make it runnable
3. Run the command ./unzip.sh or ./unzip_remove.sh

Use at your own risk, I am not responsible for lost files. Always make a backup of your files.
